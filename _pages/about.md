Hi, welcome to my homepage! I am Wenlong Ji, a third-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Lihua Lei](https://lihualei71.github.io/). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University. During my undergraduate study, I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Bin Dong](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/), Prof. [Weijie Su](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/), Prof. [Linjun Zhang](https://linjunz.github.io/), and Prof. [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/).

My research interest broadly lies in statistics, machine learning, and economics, focusing on establishing the theoretical foundation and developing statistical tools for real-world problems. If you are interested in any of my research or want to collaborate with me, please feel free to reach out!
